I often find myself, more often than not, dealing with functions that could be better utilized as pipes for transforming values within the template. 
However, these functions tend to be somewhat specific and lack reusability, making it impractical to define a dedicated pipe for each one. 
After some exploration, I stumbled upon a method of declaring a pipe that accepts a function, which is then employed to transform the value.
```typescript
@Pipe({ name: 'transform' })
export class TransformPipe implements PipeTransform {

  /**
   * @param thisArg the piped argument
   * @param transformFunc the function to invoke
   * @param args additinal agruments that whill be passed to the function
   */
  public transform<T, R>(thisArg: T, transformFunc: (t: T, ...args: any[]) => R, ...args: any[]): R {
    return transformFunc(thisArg, ...args);
  }
```
With this, you can write functions in your components and pass the function itself as a pipe argument. For example:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `<p>{{fib | transform: sum}}</p>`
})

class AppComponent  {
  fib = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8];

  public sum(collection: number[]): number {
    return collection.reduce((first, second) => first + second);
  }
}
```

## Tips and Tricks
This allows you to have one pipe that can accept any function. 
One thing to consider is that this function will be called by the Angular framework, and you will be outside the context of your component. 
Thus, you will not have access to instance members inside this function. 
One way to solve that is to bind the function you want to use and pass that bound reference to the pipe.
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `<p>{{fib | transform: sumBound}}</p>`
})

class AppComponent  {
  fib = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8];
  sumBound: (collection: number[]) => number;

  constructor() {
    this.sumBound = this.sum.bind(this)
  }

  public sum(collection: number[]): number {
    return collection.reduce((first, second) => first + second);
  }
}
```

As you can see, we are binding the function to our context. 
This way, even when it's invoked by the Angular framework, we still retain access to our instance context.

## Pure and Impure
One thing you might consider is declaring one pure and one impure version of this pipe, as with pure pipes, you gain a lot of advantages if you can leverage them:
1. First, pure pipes evaluate only when the input changes. Second, they cache the outputs for previously evaluated inputs and can bind the result from the cache without re-evaluating the pipe expression if the same input was previously evaluated.
2. A single instance of a pure pipe is used for all bindings in the app, across components.
3. You just need to test the transform function, known input to known output.
But keep in mind that to be able to use a pure pipe, the function that you pass to the pipe should also be pure, and you should have a way to identify or differentiate between different inputs.
