As developers, we're constantly on the lookout for tools and techniques that make our lives easier, 
especially when it comes to debugging. 
Today, we're diving deep into a powerful utility that supercharges the debugging process for React's `useEffect` hook. 
This utility, `useEffectDebugger`, is a game-changer for those pesky useEffect issues that sometimes leave us scratching our heads. 
Let's unravel the mystery behind this utility, how it works, and why it should be your go-to tool for debugging useEffect hooks.

## The Problem with useEffect Debugging
React's `useEffect` hook is a cornerstone of functional component side effects management. 
However, understanding why a particular effect was triggered can be challenging, especially in complex components with multiple dependencies. 
This lack of transparency can lead to hours of console logging and frustration.

## Enter useEffectDebugger
The `useEffectDebugger` hook is designed to address this exact problem. 
It provides a detailed log of useEffect triggers, showing you not only when an effect is triggered but also what specific dependencies changed and their before-and-after values. 
This utility is invaluable for development environments where insight into hook behavior is crucial for speedy debugging.

## How It Works
The `useEffectDebugger` wraps around the native useEffect hook, accepting the same parameters 
with two additional ones: `depenencyNames` for clearer logging, and `logName` for easier log identification. 
It utilizes a custom hook, `usePrevious`, to keep track of the previous values of the dependencies array, 
enabling a comparison between renders.

The usePrevious Hook

Before we dive into the debugger itself, let's discuss the usePrevious hook. 
This hook captures and retains the previous value of a variable across component re-renders, an essential feature for our debugger.

```typescript
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

const usePrevious = (value, initialValue) => {
  const ref = useRef(initialValue)
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = value
  })
  return ref.current
}
```

The Core: useEffectDebugger

Now, onto the main attraction. The `useEffectDebugger` hook extends the functionality of useEffect, 
providing deep insights into dependency changes.

```typescript
export const useEffectDebugger = (
  effectHook,
  dependencies,
  depenencyNames = [],
  logName
) => {
  const previousDeps = usePrevious(dependencies, [])
  const changedDeps = dependencies.reduce((accum, dependency, index) => {
    if (dependency !== previousDeps[index]) {
      const keyName = depenencyNames[index] || index
      return {
        ...accum,
        [keyName]: { before: previousDeps[index], after: dependency },
      }
    }
    return accum
  }, {})

  if (Object.keys(changedDeps).length) {
    console.log(`ðŸª² [use-effect-debugger] ${logName ? `- ${logName} ` : ''}`, changedDeps)
  }

  useEffect(effectHook, dependencies)
}
```

## Why You Should Use It

1. **Clarity**: Understand exactly why your useEffect hook was triggered.
2. **Efficiency**: Save time otherwise spent on manual logging or guesswork.
3. **Development Speed**: Quickly identify and fix side-effect related bugs.

## Caveat
While `useEffectDebugger` is a powerful tool for development, remember to exclude it from your production builds. 
It's meant as a development aid and could introduce unnecessary performance overheads and expose internal logic details in a production environment.

## Conclusion
`useEffectDebugger` is an invaluable tool for React developers seeking to streamline their debugging process. 
By providing clear insights into the inner workings of useEffect hooks, 
it reduces debugging time and enhances code understanding. 
Incorporate it into your development workflow to tackle useEffect challenges more effectively.

Remember, tools like `useEffectDebugger` empower us to build more reliable and maintainable applications 
by understanding the intricacies of our code better. Happy debugging!
