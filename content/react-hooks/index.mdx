Today, I would like to share two hooks that I frequently find the need to use. 
The implementations are straightforward, and I often discover that it is simpler to write them myself than to add yet another npm package.

## useDebounce
This hook is very useful if you need to maintain the state of a value coming from an input field 
but don't want the update to trigger every time the user inputs a character.
```typescript
export function useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number): T {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState<T>(value)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Update debounced value after delay
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value)
    }, delay)

    // Cancel the timeout if value changes (also on delay change or unmount)
    // This is how we prevent debounced value from updating if value is changed ...
    // .. within the delay period. Timeout gets cleared and restarted.
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler)
    }
  }, [value, delay])

  return debouncedValue
}
```

As you can see, it's waiting for the requested debounce time before updating the state. 
Therefore, if you use this debounced value to trigger some heavy computation, 
you can be certain that you are doing so only when the user has stopped typing. Here is an example of how to use it:
```typescript
const [value, setValue] = useState('')
const debouncedValue = useDebounce(value, 300)

useEffect(() => {
  //DO WORK
}, [debouncedValue])
```

## useOnClickOutside
This hook addresses the need to determine when the user is clicking outside a particular element, typically for closing popups or tooltips. 
I find this approach very elegant. Instead of consistently adding global event listeners everywhere, using this hook ensures that it will clean up after itself.
```typescript
export function useOnClickOutside(
  htmlNode: HTMLElement | null,
  handler: (event?: MouseEvent | TouchEvent) => void,
): void {
  useEffect(
    () => {
      if (htmlNode) {
        const listener = (event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent) => {
          // Do nothing if clicking ref's element or descendent elements
          if (htmlNode.contains(event.target as Node)) {
            return
          }
          handler(event)
        }
        document.addEventListener('mousedown', listener)
        document.addEventListener('touchstart', listener)
        return () => {
          document.removeEventListener('mousedown', listener)
          document.removeEventListener('touchstart', listener)
        }
      }
      return undefined
    },
    // It's worth noting that because passed in handler is a new ...
    // ... function on every render that will cause this effect ...
    // ... callback/cleanup to run every render. It's not a big deal ...
    // ... but to optimize you can wrap handler in useCallback before ...
    // ... passing it into this hook.
    [htmlNode, handler],
  )
}
```

Here is an example of how to use it:
```typescript
export default function Component() {
  const ref = useRef(null)

  const handleClickOutside = () => {
    // Your custom logic here
    console.log('clicked outside')
  }

  useOnClickOutside(ref, handleClickOutside)

  return (
    <button
      ref={ref}
      style={{ width: 200, height: 200, background: 'cyan' }}
    />
  )
}
```
As you can see, you need to pass a ref to the element for which you want to determine if the user has clicked outside or not. 
After that, you have your callback to act when the user has clicked outside, allowing you to close your popup or perform whatever action is necessary.
